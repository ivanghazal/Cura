                    If you feel any heart attack symptoms, don't wait to get help.
                    Call 911 immediately.
                    Rest until an emergency team arrives.
                    Paramedics may give you an adult-strength aspirin to chew on to help prevent blood clotting.
                    If you are having chest pain and your doctor has prescribed nitroglycerin:
                    Take one dose of nitroglycerin and let it dissolve under your tongue.
                    Wait 5 minutes.
                    If chest pain doesn't improve or gets worse, call 911. The emergency operator will tell you what to do.

                    Heart Attack (Female) Symptoms
                    Discomfort, tightness, pressure, fullness, or crushing pain in the chest; pain in the back, jaw, neck, shoulders, or arms (which may radiate from the chest); shortness of breath; profuse sweating; nausea or vomiting; exhaustion or weakness; stomach or abdominal pain; anxiety; new or worse headaches

                    Overview
                    A heart attack occurs when blood flow to the heart muscle is reduced or stopped by blockage in one or more arteries. If blood supply is cut off for more than a few minutes, you may become disabled or die. Getting emergency treatment can limit or prevent damage to the heart and save your life. Women are less likely than men to believe they're having a heart attack and less likely get help right away. Some women mistakenly think heart attacks cause only chest pain. But a woman having a heart attack may just feel extreme weakness or fatigue, fullness in the chest, or back pain between the shoulder blades. Some may feel only nausea or shortness of breath. Women can't control some risk factors for heart attacks, such as age or heredity, but can control many others.
